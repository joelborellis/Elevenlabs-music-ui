# Music Creation Presets Guide

Welcome! This guide will help you understand how to create the perfect music for your needs using our simple three-choice system. You don't need to be a musician or tech expert—just pick the options that match what you're looking for, and our AI will handle the rest.

---

## How It Works

Creating music is as simple as making **three choices**:

1. **Project Blueprint** – What are you making this music for?
2. **Sound Profile** – What should it sound like?
3. **Delivery & Control** – How creative or precise should the AI be?

Plus, you can add a **User Narrative** to personalize your music with your own story, names, or special occasion.

Let's explore each choice in detail!

---

## ✍️ The User Narrative: Your Personal Story

**The User Narrative is where the magic happens for personalized music.**

This is an optional text field where you can tell the AI about the story, people, or occasion that should inspire your music. When you provide a narrative, the AI will weave those details directly into your music.

### What is a User Narrative?

A User Narrative is simply a description in your own words of:
- **Who** the music is about (names of people)
- **What** occasion or event it's for
- **Why** you're creating it (the story or emotion behind it)

### Examples of User Narratives:

> "This song is for my best friend Sarah's 30th birthday. We've been friends since college and she's always been there for me through thick and thin. She loves dancing and always makes everyone laugh."

> "I'm proposing to my girlfriend Emma next month. We met at a coffee shop three years ago when she accidentally took my drink. I want this song to capture how lucky I feel to have found her."

> "This is for my dad's retirement party. His name is Robert and he worked as a teacher for 35 years. He always told us to follow our dreams and work hard."

### How the User Narrative Affects Your Music

**If your music has singing (vocals):**
- The lyrics will be written specifically about your story
- Names you provide will appear in the actual lyrics
- The emotional tone matches your occasion (joyful for celebrations, tender for love songs, proud for achievements)
- The AI creates original lyrics that tell YOUR story

**If your music is instrumental only:**
- The story influences the emotional journey of the music
- Happy stories get brighter, more uplifting melodies
- Romantic stories get tender, intimate arrangements
- Triumphant stories build to powerful, satisfying climaxes
- The music becomes a "musical portrait" of your story

**If your music is for voiceover:**
- The AI may suggest voiceover script ideas based on your story
- The musical mood supports your narrative
- Space is left in the music for speaking

### Tips for Writing a Great User Narrative

1. **Include specific names** — Don't just say "my friend," say "my friend Maria"
2. **Mention the occasion** — Birthday? Anniversary? Graduation? Be specific
3. **Share the emotion** — What feeling do you want to capture? Joy? Gratitude? Love?
4. **Add meaningful details** — Inside jokes, shared memories, or special moments make it personal
5. **Keep it genuine** — Write naturally, like you're telling a friend

### What NOT to Include

For your privacy, avoid including:
- Home addresses
- Phone numbers or emails
- Financial information
- Medical details
- Any sensitive personal data

The AI will automatically remove such information if you accidentally include it.
